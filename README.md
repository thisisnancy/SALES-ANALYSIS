# SALES-ANALYSIS AND INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD
This project analyzes sales data to uncover trends in sales performance, regional differences, product popularity, and time-of-day sales patterns. 
### Key insights include:
Seasonality: December sales nearly doubled January's, driven by holiday shopping.  
Regional Variations: San Francisco led with $8.26M in sales, while Portland (ME) had the lowest at under $450K.  
Top Products: AAA Batteries (4-pack) were the best-sellers, with 31,017 units sold. Other popular items included AA Batteries, USB-C Charging Cables, and premium items like MacBook Pro and Apple AirPods.  
Sales by Time: Peak sales occurred mid-morning (10-11 AM) and evening (5-8 PM), with low activity in early morning (2-5 AM) and late night (after 9 PM).
The analysis highlights the importance of seasonal trends, regional preferences, and consumer behavior in shaping sales strategies.
